# nicar-2026-polars

This repo contains resources for the NICAR 2026 workshop [Analyzing election data with Polars and Python](https://schedules.ire.org/nicar-2026/#/session/1061).

## Software environment

The workshop requires a Python project folder with a virtual environment that has `ipython`, `jupyterlab` and `polars` installed. This repo uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to set up the virtual environment and to install the packages, but the instructions can be adapted to use plain `pip` or `pipenv`. The Python version should be version 3.13 or later. See the [Environment](docs/environment.md) documentation for detailed notes on setting up the environment.

## Workshop notes

The notes for the workshop can be found in [workshop.md](/workshop.md).
